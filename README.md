# MachineLearning-ClimateWins
Climate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate
change around Europe and, potentially, the world. It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions
from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data
from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of
other data. However, it’s hard to grasp how everything is changing in the world at once. This is
where machine learning comes in! Because ClimateWins is still a small organization without a
lot of resources, I’ll be working as a data analyst, data scientist, researcher, and trainee all at
the same time to help them with this project.
